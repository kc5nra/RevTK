# Documentation #

Please find the documentation and join us at [Reviewing the Kanji Developer Hub](http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/RevTK_Developers_Hub).
 
The easiest introduction to the Symfony-based MVC framework is to go through the included [Core documentation](http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/RtkDev:Core_Documentation) application. After installing locally you will find it at `/core.php` from your virtual host name.

The MVC structure and API is essentially the same as Symfony 1.2, so most examples will also apply to developing with Symfony. The two major differences are that an API similar to Zend_Db is used for database, and all the configuration files are in plain php (instead of YAML).

## Project Discussion ##

We are currently using [a dedicated topic](http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=4998&action=new) on the community forums.

You can subscribe to that topic ([subscribe link](http://forum.koohii.com/misc.php?subscribe=4998)) and you will receive an email whenever there is a new post there (make sure that your email is correct in your forum profile).

## Project Roadmap ##

The project roadmap (planned bug fixes and features) is available on the RevTK Wiki page: [Project Roadmap](http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/RtkDev:Project_Roadmap).

The items will be detailed as time avails. If you are really inclined to help fixing bugs, please ask for details on the forum (see above).

**The priority for the next release(s) is to fix bugs and lay the groundwork for the Chinese version (Reviewing the Hanzi).**

## Issue Tracking ##

Which bugtracking/issue tracking solution to use is not decided yet.

I'm in favor of using the wiki itself for now to keep things simple:

* If you're working on something, mark your name next to it in wiki format [[User:your_name]]. This will create a link to your RtkWiki profile page (you'll need to register there first).
* If you want to add an issue, please post it in the forum topic, and I may add it later to the Roadmap page.
* New features/ideas should be posted on the forum too.
* Note how many issues in the Roadmap page have a link, if it was reported in the forum, then you will find more information about the issue/bug in the linked topic.
